## Description
This project is a small fun project I created to review my HTML, CSS and Javascript. It shows a shape on the screen after a random amount of time delay
and the user has to click on the shape as quick as possible. The application shows the user's most recent reaction time, their fastest time and the average time. It also has a Dark/Light mode toggle 
button and a pause button with different options to resume, restart, or quit the game.gi
